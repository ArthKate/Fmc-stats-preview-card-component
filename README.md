## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learnt the fluidity of of using flexbox.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100dvh;
}

.card-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  max-width: 70em;
  height: 480px;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.right-col,
.left-col {
  flex: 1 1 50%;
  min-width: 300px;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

```
### Continued development

Am going to continue learning design responsive layouts using both flex and grid


### Useful resources
